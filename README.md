# Creating Space

Systematic apartment decluttering toward minimalism using proven frameworks. Transform cluttered living space into a calm, spacious environment that supports minimalist lifestyle and prepares for VanLife transition.

## Brief

**Problem**: Apartment has accumulated excessive clutter creating physical and mental friction; current state blocks transition to minimalist living and eventual VanLife setup; lack of systematic decluttering approach leads to decision paralysis and ineffective attempts.

**What I'm Solving**: Systematically reduce apartment contents to essentials using proven minimalist frameworks while maintaining visibility of stored items and tracking progress objectively; build sustainable habits to prevent clutter return.

## Purpose

Reduce apartment clutter by at least 50%, establish a minimalist lifestyle with sustainable maintenance systems, and prepare for eventual VanLife transition. Create a calm, spacious living environment where everything has a designated place and cleaning takes 20 minutes instead of 2 hours.

## Vision

Wild success is walking into the apartment and feeling immediate calm because there's space, order, and simplicity. Own only things that are used or truly loved. Everything has a designated place. Cleaning takes 20 minutes instead of 2 hours. Feel liberated rather than weighed down by possessions. Friends visit and comment on how peaceful the space feels. No longer avoid having people over.

## Success Criteria

The project is complete when:

1. **Quantifiable Clutter Reduction**: At least 50% reduction in visible clutter measured by before/after photos analyzed by LLM or manual counting. Comprehensive photos from multiple angles taken in January 2026.

2. **Storage Items Relocated**: Successfully pack and move at least 10 boxes to sister's place in Hershey. Items catalogued in simple inventory (spreadsheet/app).

3. **Van Cleaned and Organized**: Van completely decluttered, cleaned, ready for use or sale. Can take proud "after" photos.

4. **Minimalist Criteria Established**: Decision framework created and implemented (Used in last 6 months? Brings genuine joy? Would I buy this again today?)

5. **Maintenance System Created**: Simple weekly cleaning routine that maintains minimalist space (15-20 min/day). Successfully executed for 4 consecutive weeks.

6. **Physical Space Metrics**: All horizontal surfaces clear except active-use items, all closets/storage at 70% capacity or less, floor space visible and walkable throughout.

## Method: KonMari Framework

Following Marie Kondo's method, decluttering proceeds by category (not location) in this order:

1. **Clothes** (including underwear, outerwear, jewelry, accessories, bags)
2. **Books**
3. **Papers**
4. **Komono (Miscellaneous Items)** - kitchen items, bathroom products, cleaning supplies, tools, electronics, home decor, craft supplies
5. **Sentimental Items** (last, hardest)

**Core Principles**:
- Tidy by category, NOT by location
- Gather everything from that category from entire home before deciding
- Hold each item, use physical touch to assess connection
- Ask "Does this spark joy?" - pay attention to body response
- Thank items before discarding (gratitude vs. guilt mindset)
- Discard first completely, THEN organize what remains

## Key Tasks

### Pack Clutter
Systematically remove clutter from apartment by packing items for storage with comprehensive inventory tracking. Pack and transport 10+ boxes to sister's storage achieving 30%+ visible clutter reduction.

### Assess Clutter Level
Create objective visual baseline of apartment's current clutter state through 8-10 angle photos throughout apartment. Enables before/after comparison and strategic planning.

## Manhattan-Specific Strategies

- Maximize vertical space with shelves, wall-mounted organizers
- Multi-functional furniture essential: storage ottomans, under-bed storage
- "One in, one out" rule: when buying something new, donate/discard one similar item
- Clear surfaces principle: keep countertops, tables, desks minimal
- Daily tidying ritual: 5-15 minutes end-of-day reset
- Designated drop-off zone near entrance
