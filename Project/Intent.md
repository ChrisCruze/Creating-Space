Problem: My apartment is very messy, and I have far too much stuff. I hold onto things for sentimental value and struggle to let go, even when items serve no practical purpose. The clutter creates mental load, makes it harder to keep things clean, and prevents me from living the minimalist lifestyle I aspire to.

Vision: Wild success is walking into my apartment and feeling immediate calm because there's space, order, and simplicity. I own only things I use or truly love. Everything has a designated place. Cleaning takes 20 minutes instead of 2 hours. I feel liberated rather than weighed down by possessions. Friends visit and comment on how peaceful my space feels. I no longer avoid having people over.

Opportunity: This unlocks mental clarity and reduced stress. A clean environment improves focus, sleep, and overall wellbeing. It saves time on cleaning and searching for things. It creates space for new experiences rather than being buried under old possessions.
