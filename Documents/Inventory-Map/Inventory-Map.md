# The Physical Reality & Inventory Map

> "**What do I physically have, where can it live, and what is unresolved?**"

## Purpose

This document defines _what exists_, not what to do. This is about **space and objects**, not time or behavior. For maintenance routines and decision rules, see [[Operating-System]].

## Key Principles

- **Speed over elegance** - The goal is retrieval, not perfection
- **Physical truth** - Document what actually exists, not what you wish existed
- **Specific homes** - Every item needs a designated location
- **Unresolved is temporary** - Items without homes get review dates, not permanent limbo

## The Five Essential Questions

### 1. What space do I actually have?

**Purpose**: List real, physical containers. Define limits. Space = constraint.

#### Manhattan Apartment Physical Space Inventory

**Primary Living Space**:
- Bedroom closet (6 ft wide, 2 ft deep)
- Under-bed storage (2 bins maximum, 18" high clearance)
- Bedroom dresser (6 drawers)
- Bedroom nightstand (1 drawer)
- Kitchen cabinets (upper: 4, lower: 4)
- Kitchen drawers (3)
- Bathroom vanity (2 drawers, under-sink cabinet)
- Living room storage ottoman (1)
- Entryway closet (small, 2 ft wide)
- Wall-mounted shelves (3 shelves, 4 ft wide)

**Storage Areas**:
- Sister's storage unit (Hershey) - 10 boxes maximum
- Van storage (if applicable) - TBD

**Space Constraints**:
- No attic
- No garage
- No basement
- Limited floor space
- Vertical storage essential

**Template - Space Inventory**:

| Location | Dimensions | Capacity | Current Use |
|----------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Bedroom closet | 6' x 2' | 70% max | Clothes, shoes |
| Under-bed bin #1 | 18" x 24" x 6" | Full | Seasonal clothes |
| Under-bed bin #2 | 18" x 24" x 6" | Empty | Available |
| Kitchen upper cabinet 1 | 2' x 1' | 60% | Plates, bowls |
| Kitchen upper cabinet 2 | 2' x 1' | 80% | Glasses, mugs |
| Entryway closet | 2' x 1.5' | 90% | Coats, bags |
| Storage ottoman | 2' x 1.5' x 1' | 50% | Blankets, linens |

**Success Metric**: Every container has a defined capacity limit and current usage percentage

### 2. What items are intentionally owned and assigned?

**Purpose**: Each item has a specific purpose and specific home. Avoid vague categories like "miscellaneous."

#### Manhattan Apartment Assigned Items

**Kitchen - Assigned Items**:
- Camping stove - Lives in: Kitchen lower cabinet #3 (back) - Purpose: Camping trips only
- Travel toiletry kit - Lives in: Bathroom drawer #2 - Purpose: Carry-on trips only
- Coffee maker - Lives in: Kitchen counter (active use) - Purpose: Daily coffee
- Cast iron skillet - Lives in: Kitchen lower cabinet #1 - Purpose: Cooking

**Bedroom - Assigned Items**:
- Winter coat - Lives in: Entryway closet - Purpose: Winter outerwear
- Hiking boots - Lives in: Bedroom closet floor - Purpose: Hiking, outdoor activities
- Workout clothes - Lives in: Dresser drawer #3 - Purpose: Gym, running

**Template - Assigned Items Inventory**:

| Item | Purpose | Home Location | Context/Notes |
|------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Camping stove | Camping trips | Kitchen lower cabinet #3 (back) | Only for camping, not daily use |
| Travel toiletry kit | Carry-on trips | Bathroom drawer #2 | Pre-packed, ready to go |
| Coffee maker | Daily coffee | Kitchen counter | Active use item |
| Cast iron skillet | Cooking | Kitchen lower cabinet #1 | Primary cooking pan |
| Winter coat | Winter outerwear | Entryway closet | Seasonal, Oct-Mar |
| Hiking boots | Hiking, outdoor | Bedroom closet floor | Used 2-3x/month |
| Workout clothes | Gym, running | Dresser drawer #3 | 5 sets, rotate weekly |

**Success Metric**: Every intentionally owned item has both a purpose and a home documented

### 3. What items are unresolved?

**Purpose**: Items you're unsure about go in a safe holding area with a review date to avoid forever-purgatory.

#### Manhattan Apartment Unresolved Items

**Unresolved Bin Location**: Under-bed bin #2 (temporary)

**Current Unresolved Items**:
- Old ski boots - No current use - Review date: March 1, 2026
- College textbooks - Unclear if needed - Review date: February 15, 2026
- Broken camera - Repair or discard? - Review date: January 30, 2026
- Gift items (unwanted) - Donate or regift? - Review date: February 1, 2026

**Template - Unresolved Items Tracking**:

| Item | Current Location | Issue/Question | Review Date | Decision Rule to Apply |
|------|------------------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Old ski boots | Under-bed bin #2 | No current use, haven't skied in 2 years | March 1, 2026 | 6-month rule: if unused, goes |
| College textbooks | Under-bed bin #2 | Unclear if needed for reference | February 15, 2026 | "Would I buy again?" test |
| Broken camera | Under-bed bin #2 | Repair cost vs. replacement value | January 30, 2026 | Cost-benefit analysis |
| Gift items | Under-bed bin #2 | Donate or regift? | February 1, 2026 | "Does it spark joy?" test |

**Rules for Unresolved Items**:
- Maximum 1 bin/container for unresolved items
- Every item gets a review date (no more than 3 months out)
- At review date, apply decision rules from [[Operating-System]]
- If still unresolved after review, default action: donate/discard

**Success Metric**: Zero items stay unresolved for more than 3 months

### 4. What items are tied to a specific context?

**Purpose**: Prevent duplicate purchases and ensure items are used in their intended context.

## Integration with Operating System

This Inventory Map works in tandem with [[Operating-System]]:

- **Inventory Map** defines **what** you own and **where** it lives
- **Operating System** defines **when** and **how often** you maintain
- **Physical Tracking** (here) prevents forgetfulness
- **Decision Rules** (there) prevent accumulation

Together, they create a closed loop. See [[Two-System-Approach]] for the complete framework.

## Manhattan-Specific Considerations

- **Vertical storage** (wall shelves, closet top shelves) must be documented
- **Under-bed bins** are prime real estate - track carefully
- **Multi-functional furniture** (storage ottoman) needs inventory
- **Sister's storage** requires box numbering system for remote tracking
- **Limited space** means every item's home must be intentional

## Maintenance of This Map

**When to Update**:
- Immediately when items are added (assign home or mark unresolved)
- Immediately when items are removed (update inventory)
- Weekly during [[Operating-System]] weekly maintenance (verify locations)
- Monthly during [[Operating-System]] monthly review (update percentages, resolve items)

**Update Frequency**: 
- Real-time for additions/removals
- Weekly verification
- Monthly comprehensive review
