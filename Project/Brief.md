# Brief

**Problem**: Apartment has accumulated excessive clutter creating physical and mental friction; current state blocks transition to minimalist living and eventual VanLife setup; lack of systematic decluttering approach leads to decision paralysis and ineffective attempts.

**What I'm Solving**: Systematically reduce apartment contents to essentials using proven minimalist frameworks while maintaining visibility of stored items and tracking progress objectively; build sustainable habits to prevent clutter return.

**Success Looks Like**: 
- Photo documentation showing clear before/after transformation across 8-10 angles
- All non-essential items either eliminated or stored with complete inventory tracking
- Apartment feels spacious and livable with only essential items present
- Inventory spreadsheet allows instant lookup of any stored item
- Foundation established for smooth VanLife transition
- Daily/weekly habits implemented to maintain decluttered state long-term
- Decision-making framework internalized for evaluating all possessions

**Explicitly NOT Included**:
- Deep cleaning or aesthetic improvements
- Organizing systems for keeping clutter (the goal is elimination, not organization)
- Storage unit rental (using sister's space)
- Selling items for income (speed over optimization - donate immediately)
- One-time heroic effort without sustainable systems

**What Matters Most Right Now**:
- Complete photo baseline from all angles (by January 5)
- Implement KonMari category approach starting with clothes (by January 15)
- Pack and inventory 10+ boxes for storage (by January 12)
- Transport first load to storage with Omar (by January 15)
- Establish daily 15-minute decluttering session habit (starting January 5)
- Research findings integrated into execution plan (completed January 4)

**Timeline**: No hard deadline, but targeting significant visible progress by end of January 2026; sustainable ongoing practice beyond initial intensive phase.

**Core Insight**: Decluttering isn't about better organization—it's about radical elimination paired with systematic tracking to prevent regression, building decision-making infrastructure using "spark joy" efficiency, and establishing daily practices that make minimalism the natural default rather than constant effort.
