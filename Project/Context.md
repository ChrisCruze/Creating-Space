# Context

**Initiative**: Creating Space - Apartment decluttering toward minimalism using proven frameworks

**My Role**: Sole decision-maker and executor for personal living space transformation

**Current Date**: January 4, 2026 - Research phase completed, ready for systematic execution

**Critical Deadline**: None hard-set, but aiming for substantial progress by January 31, 2026

**Technical Requirement**: Simple inventory spreadsheet that tracks box contents without complexity overhead

**Immediate Blocker**: None currently - baseline photo assessment underway, research completed

**Stakeholder Teams**: 
- Personal (Chris): Decision-making and execution
- Family support: Yalitza (storage space), Omar (transportation)

**Key Stakeholder Concerns**: 
- Chris: Needs visible progress tracking, systematic approach, sustainable habits
- Yalitza: Storage space availability and access logistics
- Omar: Transportation timing and vehicle capacity

**Minimalist Decluttering Framework** (based on January 4, 2026 research):
- KonMari five-category sequence: Clothes → Books → Papers → Miscellaneous → Sentimental
- Tidy by category not location (gather all items from category across entire apartment)
- "Does this spark joy?" decision criterion using physical touch
- Thank items before discarding (gratitude vs. guilt mindset)
- 15-minute focused sessions prevent overwhelm
- Daily reset rituals maintain progress
- "One in, one out" rule prevents accumulation
- Manhattan-specific: vertical storage, multi-functional furniture, clear surfaces

**Current State** (as of January 4, 2026):
- Photo baseline in progress: 8-10 angles throughout apartment
- Several boxes already packed: ready for storage
- Inventory spreadsheet: created and operational
- Storage location: secured via Yalitza
- Transportation: Omar available for moving boxes
- Research completed: minimalist methods, KonMari framework, NYC-specific strategies integrated
- Next action: begin KonMari clothes category after photo baseline completion

**Available Resources**:
- Sister Yalitza: storage space access
- Brother Omar: transportation assistance
- Spreadsheet tool: Google Sheets or Excel for inventory
- Camera/phone: photo documentation capability
- Personal time: can dedicate focused 15-minute daily sessions
- Research findings: comprehensive decluttering frameworks and strategies
- Donation infrastructure: local shelters, Goodwill, The RealReal for valuable items

**Dependencies**:
- Omar's schedule for transportation timing
- Yalitza's storage space access
- Own decision-making capacity for keep/store/eliminate choices
- Daily commitment to 15-minute sessions

**Success Metrics**:
- Number of boxes packed and inventoried
- Visual comparison between baseline and current photos
- Square footage of apartment space reclaimed
- Percentage of items eliminated vs. stored
- Ability to locate any stored item within 2 minutes using inventory
- Consistency of daily 15-minute decluttering sessions
- Successful completion of all five KonMari categories in sequence

**Connection to Other Projects**:
- VanLife: Minimalism practice for eventual full-time van living
- Debt reduction: Less stuff = easier transition to rent-free living
- Home Environment life area: One of eight 2026 focus areas
- 100% standard: Applies to thoroughness of decluttering
- Systematic living: Builds decision-making and habit infrastructure

**Constraints**:
- Storage space is limited (sister's generosity, not unlimited facility)
- Transportation depends on Omar's availability
- Apartment must remain livable during process
- Can't eliminate everything (need basics until VanLife transition)
- Manhattan apartment space limitations require vertical solutions
- Time availability limited to 15-minute daily sessions plus occasional longer weekend blocks

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Complete photo baseline (8-10 angles)
2. Start KonMari clothes category (gather all from apartment, assess each)
3. Daily 15-minute focused sessions on current category
4. Box and inventory items for storage with detailed tracking
5. Immediate donation of eliminated items (no "sell" pile delays)
6. Progress to books, papers, miscellaneous, sentimental in sequence
7. Implement daily reset ritual once initial declutter complete
8. Enforce "one in, one out" rule moving forward

**Manhattan-Specific Challenges**:
- Small closets in older building require aggressive elimination
- Limited floor space demands vertical storage solutions
- Clutter accumulates faster in compact spaces
- Every item must justify its physical footprint

**Research-Informed Insights** (January 4, 2026):
- Clutter creates measurable anxiety, stress, concentration difficulty
- Decluttering reduces household tasks by 40%
- Category-based approach prevents repeating work across rooms
- Physical touch with items improves decision quality
- Gratitude mindset reduces discarding guilt
- Daily 5-15 minute sessions more sustainable than periodic marathons
- Clear surfaces reduce cognitive load and enable better thinking
- Common NYC clutter: excess mugs/bottles, expired pantry items, unused gadgets, bathroom product overflow, clothing in uncertain status

**Missing Resources**: None identified currently - have what's needed to proceed with systematic execution
