Immediate Next Actions (Tonight/Tomorrow):
1. Take comprehensive "before" photos from 8-10 angles throughout apartment (30 min - TONIGHT)
2. Pack at least 5 boxes for sister's tomorrow - prioritize seasonal, sentimental not in use, duplicates (3-4 hours - TONIGHT)
3. Clean out van during tomorrow's trip with Omar - trash, donate items, organize what stays (2-3 hours tomorrow)
4. Create simple inventory spreadsheet of what's stored at sister's (1 hour tomorrow evening)

Key Milestones:
- Tomorrow: First load to sister's, van cleaned
- Week 2: Major decluttering session, 30% reduction
- Week 4: 50% reduction goal, "after" photos
- Week 6: Maintenance routine established, clean for 2 consecutive weeks
- Month 3: Sustained minimalist lifestyle, no backsliding

Critical Decisions: Start tonight or wait for weekend? Which room first? 50% vs 30% goal? What counts as "sentimental"? Van: keep or sell? Storage: temporary or long-term?
