This project is complete when:

1. Quantifiable Clutter Reduction: At least 50% reduction in visible clutter measured by before/after photos analyzed by LLM or manual counting. Take comprehensive photos from multiple angles in January 2026.

2. Storage Items Relocated: Successfully pack and move at least 10 boxes to sister's place in Hershey. Items catalogued in simple inventory (spreadsheet/app).

3. Van Cleaned and Organized: Van completely decluttered, cleaned, ready for use or sale. Can take proud "after" photos.

4. Minimalist Criteria Established: Decision framework created and implemented (Used in last 6 months? Brings genuine joy? Would I buy this again today?)

5. Maintenance System Created: Simple weekly cleaning routine that maintains minimalist space (15-20 min/day). Successfully executed for 4 consecutive weeks.

6. Physical Space Metrics: All horizontal surfaces clear except active-use items, all closets/storage at 70% capacity or less, floor space visible and walkable throughout
